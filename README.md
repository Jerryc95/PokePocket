# PokePocket
## Description
PokePocket is a Pokedex written in pure Swift using the SwiftUI framework. It allows users to view and search a list of all Pokemon and view information for each Pokemon. This includes an image, stats, description, evolution chain and found locations.

PokePocket uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to obtain its data.
